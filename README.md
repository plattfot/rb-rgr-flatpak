Flatpak manifest for HP's Zcentral Remote Boost Receiver (RGR)

Which seems to be a replacement for HP's RG receiver.

I got tired of it breaking all the time when installing it using
[AUR](https://github.com/plattfot/rb-rgr-aur) (it does not play nice with wayland). Hopefully this will be
more stable as a flatpak.
